# audio_cluster
A high level class for handling multitrack audio, with some basic built in sounds.

The default export of the main file will be a class that has an audio context, and a master volume implemented with a gain node. Other features will be added, but the basic functionality of a master volume control seems obvious, and using the already included gain node to accomplish this is the most efficient method.
